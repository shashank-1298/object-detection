Overview
Object detection is a computer vision task that involves detecting and localizing objects in images or videos. YOLOv8 is a powerful object detection model that can identify multiple objects in real-time with high accuracy.

Dependencies
To run the code in this repository, you need the following Python libraries:

PyTorch
OpenCV
Numpy
You can install these dependencies using the following command:

!pip install ultralytics
Custom Dataset
For this project, we use a custom dataset containing images with annotated objects that we want to detect. The dataset should be structured in a way that YOLOv8 can understand, i.e., in the format of image files along with corresponding annotation files (e.g., YOLO format .txt files).

Data Preparation
Organize the custom dataset into train, validation, and test sets.
Prepare annotation files for each image in the YOLO format, specifying the object's class and bounding box coordinates.

Model Training
Load the YOLOv8 model and pre-trained weights.
Fine-tune the model on the custom dataset using transfer learning.
Adjust hyperparameters and train the model on the training set.
Model Evaluation
Evaluate the trained model's performance on the validation set using relevant metrics such as mean average precision (mAP) and accuracy.
Object Detection
Use the trained YOLOv8 model to perform real-time object detection on new images or videos.
Visualize the detected objects with bounding boxes and class labels.
Results and Insights
Analyze the results of object detection, including any challenges faced and potential improvements to the model's performance.
